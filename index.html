    <h4>
        Troubleshooting
    </h4>
    <p>
        Occasionally, signing in might not go as seamless as you would like. If you are having difficulty, check to see if you have:
    </p>
    <h4>
        Wrong Login info: 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Make sure to double check your email and passwords. This may seem obvious and it's common to put something in caps lock or miss-spell something. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        Two-factor authentication issues:
    </h4>
    <p>
        If it is stuck on verification, make sure your device is in line with the local time. A code will not work if it is out of sync with the codes time zone. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        Browser or device glitches: 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Try simply clearing cache and getting back into the site, or simply switching devices to see if that affects your login process. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        Forgot Password?:
    </h4>
    <p>
        Use the link on the login page that says "forgot your password"? You will be emailed a link to reset your password that is registered with the site. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Still facing issues? Reach out to Exness through live chat or email for a response as quick as possible. Exness offers regional support for different regions like Exness Dubai.
